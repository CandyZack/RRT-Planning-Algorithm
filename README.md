RRT Algorithm

Explanation:
The implementation is done in Python 3. The module used is PyGame, it provides UI to visualize the Algorithm in running state. I can implement this algorithm in CPP, but I thought of using nice UI to see how the algorithm is working, so I used Python's PyGame for it.


How to Run:
1) Install PyGame 1.9.4 module in Python 3
2) Running in Sypder is recommended.
3) Run this given Deep_RRT.py directly in Python3 environment.
4) It will open an UI.
5) Further instruction is given in the UI itself.


Note:
Make sure to keep obstacles such that they don't have any breaking of pixels in the line[Move the mouse pointer slowly], or else the tree will go through it. Make sure the boundary of obstacles are thick enough for not having any illegal jumps over it.

Also, check the sample pictures included.

Let me know if there is any confusion. It was really fun learning this.
