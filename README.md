How to Run:
1) Install PyGame 1.9.4 module in Python 3
2) Running in Sypder is recommended.
3) Run RRT_Source_Code.py directly in Python3 environment.
4) It will open an UI.
5) Further instruction is given in the UI itself.


Note:
Make sure to keep obstacles such that they don't have any breaking of pixels in the line[Move the mouse pointer slowly], or else the searching tree will go through it. Make sure the boundary of obstacles are thick enough for not having any illegal jumps over it.
